# Learning Objectives

1. Learn how to interpret causal effects in controlled regression and build a model to estimate the impact of customer satisfaction on lifetime value.

2. Build a regression discontinuity design to estimate the impact of customer support on renewals.

3. Create a difference-in-differences model to measure pricing impact.

4. Learn how to create instrumental variables and measure effects using two-stage least squares.

5. Discover techniques at the intersection of machine learning and causal inference, such as double selection and causal forests.
